 The meaning of the word "Tapiraiauara"
 --------------------------------------

 Is probably from Guarani (Ñheengatu variant of the Brazilian  
 Amazon), I think the roots are from 'tapir' ("tapii" in Guarani-Paraguayo) and
 'aguara'(fox) or yagua (tigre), there are lots of tiger-like animals
 with the 'yagua' in them.

 The 'L' in the tapilrauara spelling may be a mistake, although old
 Guarani had consonant final -r (hence tapir), and this might assimilate
 to 'l' in local speech today.

 As I found below in an article by Antonio Carlos Deigues, it refers to
 a mythical animal in caboclo riverine culture  (head and feet of
 leopard, body of painted buffalo, back feet of a horse).  There are  
 many Guarani traces in Caboclo language and culture from Nheengatu. 

 "The mythical world of  ìcaboclo fishermenî of the Amazonian rivers
 and estuaries is filled with  spiritual beings or encantaria of the
 forest or water, that can favour or harm him.
 The worlds of forest and water are two separated domains:  two
 extensions of the fishermen/caboclo's lives. There are supernatural
 entities (caruanas, bichos do fundo [animals of the depth], mãe d'água
 [water's mother]) capable of casting spells or haunting and and
 bewitching those who abuse or disrespect the rights and rules
 pertaining to the use of these environments. In this case, a belief
 that one should not harvest more than one needs is reinforced. Like the
 forest, aquatic areas along with their human  inhabitants also have
 their protective spirits, with the power to harass those who engage in
 destructive resource use. 

 There also exists the cobra grande (great snake), the Tapiraiauara, 
 and the onça d'água (water leopard ), which inhabit, respectively, 
 the depths of lakes and the rivers (igapós)."
