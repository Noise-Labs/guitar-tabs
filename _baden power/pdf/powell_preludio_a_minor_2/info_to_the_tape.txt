The show "Jazzfestival Burghausen" was shown at the german tv over twenty years ago.

Baden performed some solo pieces, also one with the brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira.

The performance of this tv-show had a complete running time of twenty-one minutes.


The tracklist of the Burghausen tape is:
========================================
1. Samba Do Aviao 
2. Desafinado - with Airto Moreira 
3. Preludio a-minor 
4. Pandeiro Improvisation - Airto Moreira
